# Minecraft AFK bot for servers

## the problem

aternos servers kept on shutting down when no player is online, and needed to be manually restarted.

## the solution

break tos and make an afk bot so the server always has a player on.

### bot features

1. walks around in a confined space.
2. sleeps at night so in the case that everyone wants to sleep through the night the bot doesn't get in the way.
3. yea that's about all you need, I think.

_note:_
_is 100% going to be discontinued_
